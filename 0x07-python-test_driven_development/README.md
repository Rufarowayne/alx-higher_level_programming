0x07. Python - Test-driven development
This directory contains source code files and scripts (bash and Python scripts) as well as *.txt files on Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

Concepts
TDD
doctest
unittest
How to run
Python script files contains the line #!/usr/bin/python3, the path to the python interpreter followed by Python instructions.

To run each Python script you would need to create a bash script as depicted below.

Each bash script should contain #!/usr/bin/bash followed by any of these:

python3 $PYFILE where $PYFILE is the environment variable that stores the Python script file to be interpreted
python3 $PYCODE where $PYCODE is the environment variable that stores the Python code to be interpreted
Test Files
There are additional .txt files in this directory that stores the test cases or examples to be executed by doctest
